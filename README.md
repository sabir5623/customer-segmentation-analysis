Customer Segmentation Analysis using Python
This repository contains code for performing customer segmentation analysis using clustering algorithms. The primary objective is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses tailor marketing strategies for different customer groups.

Key Features: Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning and transforming customer data to make it suitable for clustering. Clustering Algorithms: K-means Clustering: Applied to partition customers into distinct clusters based on their behavior. Hierarchical Clustering: Used to build a hierarchy of clusters and visualize the relationships between them. Analysis and Interpretation: Detailed analysis of the clusters to understand the characteristics of each customer segment. Visualization: Includes visualizations such as cluster plots and dendrograms to help interpret the results.
